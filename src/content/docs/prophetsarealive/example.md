### The Prophets Are Alive

The subject of the Prophets being alive (Hayāt al-Anbiyā) is also one where our adversaries have a much different opinion than the Ahlus Sunnah. Members affiliated with the misguided sects spend all their time and efforts in trying to prove that, after passing away from this world, the Prophets have all died and mingled with the dust (Ma’d al-Ḥāl). The view and belief of the Ahlus Sunnah is that the Prophets ﷺ experience death for a moment in order to fulfil the promise of Allāh ﷻ that all living things shall taste death. Once that promise is fulfilled, Allāh ﷻ grants them life again and they are alive in their graves just as they were alive in the world. Allāh ﷻ also arranges for them to receive sustenance in their blessed graves.

### Belief of the Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jamā’ah

In writing about the beliefs of the Ahlus Sunnah with respect to the lives of the Prophets ﷺ after they pass away, Sadr al-Sharī’ah, Haḍrat ‘Allāma Muftī Amjad ‘Alī رضى الله عنه writes:

> ‘The Prophets ﷺ are alive in the same manner that they were alive in the world. They eat and drink and go where they please. In order to fulfil the command of Allāh ﷻ (Every soul shall taste death), death comes to them but for a moment and then they are given life again. Their life (after death) is much greater and more exalted than the life (after death) of martyrs. This is why the inheritance of a martyr is distributed and his wife (after completing her mourning period (’Iddat) of four months and ten days, or if she is pregnant then until she gives birth) is able to remarry. On the other hand, it is completely the opposite for the Prophets ﷺ. Any inheritance of theirs is neither distributed, nor can anyone else marry their blessed wives for their wives are still their wives.’

> ‘One who denies the life of the Prophets ﷺ (after death) is misguided and deviant in his beliefs.’
